About this update:
	This one is only SLIGHTLY half-baked! I wanted it out before christmas and the new year so it would stop pestering the back of my mind.
	This is genuinely a massive improvement even if it's not immediately noticable. The code itself is so much easier for me to work with now
	and can be scaled much easier now. There are some missing features, such as armor not being purchasble and Combat Engine is...
	Well, it's Combat Engine. It's likely broken because I haven't tested it. But! Vendors are finally in working order again,
	so there's that. There's also some missing ASCII art but that's not exactly important nor my focus right now.

	I took it upon myself and took several months off! But for Windhelm, I'm sure you see the massive "CHANGED" section below.
	Windhelm is in... Well, a horrific state. There's year old code laying around, scripts which are written poorly and all around
	some pretty questionable things were done. This update should hopefully clean most of that mess up and bring back functionality to every
	corner of Windhelm, though some of these systems may not be connected to each other properly or work as intended.
